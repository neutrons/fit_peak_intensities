# fit_peak_intensities

This repository contains files to integrate neutron single crystal peak intensities using the Mantid analysis framework.

The scripts doICCFit.py and doBVGFit.py are meant to be scripts that can be quickly changed to allow different integration parameters (sample runs, output names, integration parameters).  Ideally, everything that needs to be changed will be at the top of the file, though this may not be the case for features still under development.
